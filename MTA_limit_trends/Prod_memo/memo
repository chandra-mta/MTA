OK, finally getting to this. Apologies for the delay. To answer your 2nd question first:

I (and the HRC team independently) determine which detector is the selected detector 
by looking at the voltage steps for the detector. There are three possible configurations:

HRC-I at full or half power, HRC-S off
HRS-S at full or half power, HRC-I off

both at half power, which occurs after SCS-107 has run and we need to manually execute 
a return to safe science commanding to set the voltage to 0 for one of the detectors. 
There is also a MSID 2IMONST and 2SPONST which is will tell you, but it is a single bit, 
and I cannot recall which bit setting corresponds to ON and which to OFF. I can modify 
my real time monitoring software to output the value in order to give you a definitive 
answer though. That will take a bit of time.

The MSIDS to determine the voltage settings are:

2SPTPAST  SP DET TOP HV STEP Caution > step 90, Warning > step 92
2SPBPAST  SP DET BOT HV STEP Caution > step 102,Warning > step 104
2IMTPAST  IM DET TOP HV STEP Caution > step 79, Warning > step 81
2IMBPAST  IM DET BOT HV STEP Caution > step 91, Warning > step 93

For half power, the HRC-I is set at 42 and 53
for half power, the HRS-S is set at 43 and 54
for full power, the HRC-I is set at 77 and 89
for full power, the HRC-S is set at 93 and 105
for off, both are set to 0 and 0

Note that the settings for the HRC-S ON are above the warning levels. This is because 
the voltage was increased in 2012. These are all steps. There are other MSIDS which 
are dn values, but really you want to monitor steps.

For M&TA, I don't see the value in tracking certain MSIDs. They are instrument settings 
and will vary as step functions. For instance, the MSID you linked to is related to 
the center blanking hi setting along the U axis. It is, in general, going to be only 
a handful of integers, depending upon the SIMODE that is chosen for the observation.

I am attaching a file which contains the complete set of HRC MSIDSs, and includes tables 
of their yellow and red limits. I believe that SKA archive has the converted values, 
so you can pull the limits out of this file. 

I will review the list of MSIDs that you sent, and tell you which are meaningful and 
which are not.
