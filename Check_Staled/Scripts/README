Staled Process Checker
######################

This script will check whether there are any process running more than a day and report back to admin

Script:
-------
check_staled_process.py

input: none
output:     email to admin
	    --- To pass emails into admin, use the sys args 'email=<address>' or 'email={<address1>,<address2>}' for multiple emails

Note:
In the script, there is a "kill_list". You can list a name of process which you would like to 
kill automatically. The name must be unique; so it could be long as 
"Disk_check/Scripts/update_html_page.py".
